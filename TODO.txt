TODO:

- Scrolling through the menu options is funky on mobile, doesn't really line
up with the section.

- Fix mobile animations for the AboutPage section.

- Get a professional headshot.

- Look into using a library for mobile resolution detection. Could be better
than simply using resolution. Probably definitely is better.
